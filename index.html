      This article explores both solutions and challenges to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation industry since planes
      are significant contributors to current climate concerns (MDPI, 2021). It focuses on the obvious solution to reducing carbon emissions,
      which is electric aeroplanes. However, this reality is hindered by battery energy density and weight limitations (The Guardian, 2021).
      This makes them impractical for long-haul flights. Due to this, the article highlights other more viable alternatives: Sustainable 
      Aviation Fuel (SAF) and hydrogen-powered aircraft. SAF, derived from renewable sources, has already demonstrated significant emission 
      reductions (Virgin Atlantic, 2023). Furthermore, hydrogen-powered planes offer a practical solution for long-haul flights, with higher 
      energy density and faster refuelling times compared to electric aircraft (Airbus, 2024). To conclude SAF and hydrogen are currently the
      most effective options in decreasing aviationâ€™s carbon emissions, and electric aircraft may become more approachable in the future as 
      battery technology advances.

        Planes are arguably the most significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. The aviation industry alone was responsible for 3.8% 
        of total carbon dioxide emissions and 13.9% of total greenhouse gas emissions from transport in 2017 at the EU level (MDPI, 2021). With 
        international agreements aiming to achieve net zero by 2050 (United Nations, 2024), this poses a major challenge, as alternative ways must be 
        found to power these aircraft without causing further or more environmental damage. A total ban on aeroplanes is not an option, as they hold 
        significant power over globalisation and transport. The easy and logical solution would be to introduce electric aircraft, as has already been 
        done with cars. However, it is far more complicated. Firstly, replacing fuel with a battery is far heavier, and an aircraft will not be able to 
        support the weight (The Guardian, 2021). Moreover, the energy used to power the battery must come from a sustainable source; otherwise, it is 
        completely pointless. As a result, alternative methods must be proposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without disrupting air transport 
        operations.

      <pre>
  Electric aircraft will likely never become a reality unless there are major advancements in battery technology. This is because replacing fuel with 
  a battery would be far heavier, meaning the aircraft will not be able to support its weight. For instance, a Boeing 747 requires around 120,000 pounds 
  (approximately 54,500 kg) of jet fuel to travel for five hours. Replacing this fuel with a battery would require a battery that weighs more than 5.8 million 
  pounds (over 2.6 million kg), almost seven times the weight of a fully fuelled plane (The Guardian, 2021). While this concept could significantly reduce 
  carbon emissions, its success depends on whether the energy used to power the batteries is sustainable or not. Additionally, renewable energy sources may not be 
  accessible in all regions. For example, solar energy is limited in countries with little sunlight such as the UK as they are weather dependent and therefore not 
  a reliable source (Solar Guide, 2023). Another point to consider is that the infrastructure needed to navigate these energy sources could harm the environment. 
  For example, the clearing of forests for space disrupts habitats. Planes are also extremely fuel-hungry, so this would require a lot more space to meet these 
  energy demands which is not currently accessible nor achievable. As a result, limitations in battery technology and immense energy demands mean that we will 
  have to wait a long time before we see an electric plane in the skies.
