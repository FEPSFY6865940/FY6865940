      This article explores both solutions and challenges to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation industry since planes
      are significant contributors to current climate concerns (MDPI, 2021). It focuses on the obvious solution to reducing carbon emissions,
      which is electric aeroplanes. However, this reality is hindered by battery energy density and weight limitations (The Guardian, 2021).
      This makes them impractical for long-haul flights. Due to this, the article highlights other more viable alternatives: Sustainable 
      Aviation Fuel (SAF) and hydrogen-powered aircraft. SAF, derived from renewable sources, has already demonstrated significant emission 
      reductions (Virgin Atlantic, 2023). Furthermore, hydrogen-powered planes offer a practical solution for long-haul flights, with higher 
      energy density and faster refuelling times compared to electric aircraft (Airbus, 2024). To conclude SAF and hydrogen are currently the
      most effective options in decreasing aviation’s carbon emissions, and electric aircraft may become more approachable in the future as 
      battery technology advances. 
      </pre>

    <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p id="Introduction_Text" class="ex1">Planes are arguably the most significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. The aviation industry alone was responsible for 3.8% 
      of total carbon dioxide emissions and 13.9% of total greenhouse gas emissions from transport in 2017 at the EU level (MDPI, 2021). With 
      international agreements aiming to achieve net zero by 2050 (United Nations, 2024), this poses a major challenge, as alternative ways must be 
      found to power these aircraft without causing further or more environmental damage. A total ban on aeroplanes is not an option, as they hold 
      significant power over globalisation and transport. The easy and logical solution would be to introduce electric aircraft, as has already been 
      done with cars. However, it is far more complicated. Firstly, replacing fuel with a battery is far heavier, and an aircraft will not be able to 
      support the weight (The Guardian, 2021). Moreover, the energy used to power the battery must come from a sustainable source; otherwise, it is 
      completely pointless. As a result, alternative methods must be proposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without disrupting air transport 
      operations.</p>
      
      
      
      
  

    <h3 id="Electric Aircraft">Electric Aircraft</h3>
   <p id="Electric_Aircraft_Text" class="ex1">Electric aircraft will likely never become a reality unless there are major advancements in battery technology. This is because replacing fuel 
      with a battery would be far heavier, meaning the aircraft will not be able to support its weight. For instance, a Boeing 747 requires around 
      120,000 pounds (approximately 54,500 kg) of jet fuel to travel for five hours. Replacing this fuel with a battery would require a battery that weighs 
      more than 5.8 million pounds (over 2.6 million kg), almost seven times the weight of a fully fuelled plane (The Guardian, 2021). While this concept 
      could significantly reduce carbon emissions, its success depends on whether the energy used to power the batteries is sustainable or not. Additionally, 
      renewable energy sources may not be accessible in all regions. For example, solar energy is limited in countries with little sunlight such as the UK as 
      they are weather dependent and therefore not a reliable source (Solar Guide, 2023). Another point to consider is that the infrastructure needed to 
      navigate these energy sources could harm the environment. For example, the clearing of forests for space disrupts habitats. Planes are also extremely 
      fuel-hungry, so this would require a lot more space to meet these energy demands which is not currently accessible nor achievable. As a result, 
      limitations in battery technology and immense energy demands mean that we will have to wait a long time before we see an electric plane in the skies.</p>
  
  <h3 id="Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)">Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)</h3>
  <p id="SAF_Text" class="ex1">One promising alternative to the electric aircraft concept is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), produced from renewable resources such as waste oils, 
      agricultural residues, and recycled carbon fuels. SAF has significantly lower carbon emissions compared to traditional jet fuel because it is derived from 
      renewable sources that absorb carbon dioxide during growth, offsetting the emissions released when the fuel is burned (MDPI, 2021). SAF offers a more 
      practical and accessible alternative to electric aircraft, especially for tackling the challenges of longer flights. This is supported by Virgin Atlantic’s 
      flight back in November 2023 where a Boeing 787 powered by 100% SAF flew from London Heathrow to New York JFK. According to Virgin Atlantic, the use of SAF in this 
      flight helped reduce carbon emissions by up to 70% times compared to traditional jet fuel (Virgin Atlantic, 2023). Whilst electric aircraft currently face 
      challenges with battery technology, making them less viable for long-haul flights, SAF provides a more approachable solution with minimal changes to existing 
      infrastructure. Therefore, highlighting that SAF is a practical and effective way to decrease the carbon footprint in the aviation industry, and leading us 
      closer to net zero.</p>
  
  <h3 id="Hydrogen-Powered Aircraft">Hydrogen-Powered Aircraft</h3>
 <p id="Hydrogen_Aircraft_Text" class="ex1">Another alternative to electric aircraft is a hydrogen-powered aircraft. Hydrogen can be used as fuel through combustion or fuel cells. Both don’t produce 
      any carbon emissions which is fantastic for the environment. Hydrogen also has three times more energy density than traditional jet fuel, whereas batteries have 
      70 times less energy than traditional jet fuel (Simple Flying, 2022). This already shows how impractical electric planes would be with the current battery 
      technology we have. Airbus has launched their ZEROe project where they want to introduce the first hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft by 2035. They are looking 
      to achieve this through hydrogen combustion and fuel cells with the test aircraft being the A380 MSN1 which is the enormous double-decker commercial plane 
      (Airbus, 2024). While this may seem like it will take a long time to complete, it’s still a more viable option compared to electric planes as that approach is 
      dependent on technology advancements. However, one disadvantage is that airports would require lots of investment for hydrogen infrastructure which is currently 
      limited. However, in the long term, the benefits still outweigh the challenges. Therefore, hydrogen is undoubtedly a better alternative compared to fully electric 
      planes especially in the near future.</p>
    
    <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
   <p id="Conclusion_Text" class="ex1">Overall, it’s clear that electric aircraft holds promise for reducing carbon emissions massively, however, there are many barriers, primarily due to the weight 
      and energy density not being able to support the aircraft through short and long-haul flights due to current battery technology (The Guardian, 2021). Furthermore, 
      the availability of sustainable energy produced isn’t consistent and is limited which makes this idea not reliable, especially with how significant air transport is. 
      In contrast, SAF and hydrogen offer more immediate alternatives with SAF already demonstrating its success through the famous flight from LHR to JFK running on 100% SAF 
      and reducing carbon emissions by up to 70% (Virgin Atlantic, 2023). Airbus also highlights that hydrogen-powered aircraft is the answer to reducing greenhouse emissions 
      whilst still operating on long-haul flights, which is credited to hydrogen’s higher energy density compared to both jet fuel and electric. To conclude, SAF and hydrogen 
      are currently the most effective for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, as technology advancements occur, the idea of electric-powered planes may become an option 
      in the future.</p>
